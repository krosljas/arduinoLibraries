# This project is concerned with "hacking" the MBot Robot Kit

# The kit in question provides a kid-friendly approach to robotics using Scratch programming
# I will be hijacking the electronic sensors provided in the kit for use with an Arduino Uno

# Using C++ and the Arduino library, I will be writing several libraries for the Arduino Uno
# Said libraries will provide an interface for said electronic sensors, which include:

# A dual-IR Sensor, implemented to provide line following functionality
# An ultrasonic sensor, implemented to provide proximity sensing 
# A motor control interface - Exploring constructing an H-Bridge using transistors 

# Subsequent plans include interfacing said components with the Arduino to build a limited autonomous vehicle
